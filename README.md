# What is Competitive Programming?

This repository contains my solutions to thousands of programming challenges from multiple online judges. The purpose of this repo is to serve as a backup of all my solutions, and at the same time serve as a resource for fellow competitive programmers who are searching the internet for clues or solutions to problems that they are stuck on. I should mention that none of these solutions are written with best Software Engineering practices in mind. The programs are written the way they are so that solutions to problems in competitions can be submitted as fast as possible. In some cases the solutions have small comments describing what the code is doing. This repository also features some good implementations for advanced data structures and algorithms like - persistent segment trees, implict treaps, heavy light decomposition, centroid decomposition, suffix automation etc.
